Suggestions as to further features to implement:
* Multiple lives
* Keeping score (highscore anyone?)
* Player attack capability
* Advancing in levels (change of background colors, enemies etc)
* Boss to beat at the end of level
* Make clouds appear as part of the background in certain cases to make it seem like you are flying between the clouds.
* Implement scenes for intro, menu, options etc.
